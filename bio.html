                <summary>Question1: What is the main goal of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in data science?</summary>
                <p>The main goal of exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to analyze and summarize the main characteristics of a dataset to gain insights and identify patterns or relationships within the data. EDA involves techniques such as summary statistics, data visualization, and data cleaning to understand the underlying structure of the data before applying more complex modeling </p>

                <summary>Question2: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in machine learning?</summary>
                <p>Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning the input data is accompanied by the correct output. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, such as predicting a target variable based on input features. In contrast, unsupervised learning involves training the model on unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find patterns or intrinsic structures in the data without explicit guidance. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning.</p>

                <summary>Question3: What is the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning models?</summary>
                <p> The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that refers to the balance between a model's bias and variance. Bias measures how closely the predictions of a model match the true values, while variance measures the sensitivity of the model to variations in the training data. A high-bias model tends to underfit the data, capturing only a simplified version of the true relationship, while a high-variance model tends to overfit the data, capturing noise in the training data as well. The goal is to find a model that achieves an appropriate balance between bias and variance to generalize well to unseen data</p>
